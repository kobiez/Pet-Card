### Pet Card

*Pet Card* app provide to the user a form that inside it they can create a card with the details of their pet.


- They need to enter the name of their pet, the max length of characters allowed is 25. 
- Also, they need to provide the age of their pet while `age >= 1` . 
- After this they select the type of their pet.
- Finally they choose it color.

The goal of the app is to create a database with pets details.
I use MongoDB in here to add a card to database.
